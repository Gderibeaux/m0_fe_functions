# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
My time management is something I need to work on. I don't need any support its really on me. Some advice I give my fellow classmates is expect the unexpected in code because sometimes the codes take longer than usual so starting homework early is better

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
 A function is like a list of instructions
 
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters. So parameters is like the folder while arguments is like the file for example the parameter can be a movie and the arugments would be comedy movies or romance movies


- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group? More on how important functions will be in our turing carears?
